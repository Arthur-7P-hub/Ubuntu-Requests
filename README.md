# 🌍 Ubuntu Image Fetcher

**"I am because we are." – Ubuntu Philosophy**

This Python script is a mindful way to collect and organize images from the web.  
It prompts the user for an image URL, downloads the image, and saves it inside a `Fetched_Images` folder for later sharing.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Prompts the user for an image URL  
- ✅ Downloads the image using the `requests` library  
- ✅ Creates a `Fetched_Images` directory (if it doesn’t exist)  
- ✅ Extracts filename from the URL or generates one automatically  
- ✅ Saves image in **binary mode** for full quality  
- ✅ Gracefully handles network errors, invalid URLs, and timeouts
